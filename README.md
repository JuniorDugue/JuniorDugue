## About Me

<details>
<summary><strong>Short Intro</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I'm a full-stack developer based out of Fort Lauderdale, FL. I love working with new technology, currently I enjoy working with JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS, and NodeJS while also learning more about Python, React Native and TypeScript.
  </p>

<details>
<summary><strong>Long Intro</strong></summary>
 <p>My name's Junior, I'm a full-stack developer & graphic designer with an interest in full-stack web development and applications.</p>
          <p>I've spent the last 18 months studying full stack javascript development at Lambda School while working full time. In their immersive program for part-time students, I learned Frontend & Backend Javascript, Complex State Management, API Development, Databases, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Computer Science among other topics.</p>
          <p>Before becoming a full-stack developer, I always had interests in technologies, gadgets, and art. I graduated from Broward College in 2012 located in South Florida with a degree in Digital Multimedia. That’s where I was first introduced to web programming, along with graphic & web design, 3D & motion graphics, and video editing.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding or designing, I'm usually watching anime, playing video games, or working up a sweat at a nearby park/gym.</p>
          <p>Being a Bootcamp grad and having previous experience with design, customer service, and multimedia technologies, I bring a unique combination of skills to the table. I'm looking for a full-stack development position at a company that believes these skillsets can be valuable to their team.</p>
          <p>If that sounds like you, feel free to reach out to me - I'm always happy to chat.</p>
          <p>-Junior</p>
